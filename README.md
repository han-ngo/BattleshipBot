# Lovelace â€“ An Intelligent Battleship Bot in Ruby

### About the game

Battleship is a popular 2-player game that takes place a 10 x 10 board. Ships of various sizes are placed on the 10 x 10 board either horizontally or vertically. The position of the ships are hidden to the user. Your task is to sink all the ships.


### Lovelace

Lovelace is an intelligent Battleship Bot completed in a short amount of time at Instructure's Intern Coding Competition. It won fourth place out of around 30 interns competing. 

This program was written in Ruby. My strategy to sink the other ship includes randomly guess a spot until getting a hit, I will then check the neighbors around that area.
